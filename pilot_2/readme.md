[This script](osm_tag_history.py) produces plots with statistics on the usage of specific OSM tags relevant to enrich the land-use/land-cover datasets by the bounding boxes of two input raster datasets (GeoTIFF).
Sample input datasets are:
- [MUCSC](https://polipapers.upv.es/index.php/raet/article/view/13112), covering Catalonia (Spain)
- [ESA Sentinel-2](https://collections.sentinel-hub.com/impact-observatory-lulc-map/), covering parts of England
